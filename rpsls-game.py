# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template


# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions

def number_to_name(number):
    # fill in your code below
    if number == 0:
        name = "rock"
    elif number == 1:
        name = 'Spock'
    elif number == 2:
        name = 'paper'
    elif number == 3:
        name = 'lizard'
    elif number == 4:
        name = 'scissors'
    else :
        print "invalid Number"
    return number

    # convert number to a name using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!

    
def name_to_number(name):
    # fill in your code below
    if name == "rock":
        'rock' == 0
    elif name == "Spock":
        Spock = 1
    elif name == "paper":
        paper = 2
    elif name == "lizard":
        lizard = 3
    elif name == "scissors":
        scissors = 4
    else :
        print "Name not in this game!"
    
    return name
    # convert name to number using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!


def rpsls(name): 
    # fill in your code below

    # convert name to player_number using name_to_number

    # compute random guess for comp_number using random.randrange()

    # compute difference of player_number and comp_number modulo five

    # use if/elif/else to determine winner

    # convert comp_number to name using number_to_name
    
    # print results

    
# test your code
rpsls("rock")
rpsls("Spock")
rpsls("paper")
rpsls("lizard")
rpsls("scissors")

# always remember to check your completed program against the grading rubric
